AI Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
Welcome to the AI Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses repository! This project is designed to demonstrate a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. By utilizing if-else statements and pattern matching techniques, the chatbot can effectively identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This project serves as a valuable introduction to natural language processing (NLP) and conversation flow, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
